            <p>Yes, I have witnessed a murder when I was 21. Now I am 71 and time has healed the wounds. I was in the Navy from 64–68. I was a Viet Nam veteran who had not seen death there. However I was on a spy ship that was blue water but we spent a lot of time in brown water to get close enough to listen to and translate Vietnamese transmissions from the Viet Cong and Cambodians. Our ship was in constant danger. We came close to being captured by the Red Chinese for nearly breaching the line that defined Hainan Island. The gunboats were waiting for us as we floundered in heavy storm seas. We almost beat the USS Pueblo, and the USS Liberty into being shot at and captured. It was indeed a tale of danger and war. I have written a short story about it so that is why I bring it up. It is because it was about being a spy for the NSA which actually had control of ship and what we did as people with high security clearances for the NSA.

                After my year aboard ship in a combat zone, my tour was up and I transferred to NAVCOMSTA Washington, DC. Those letters mean Naval Communication Station Washington, D.C. It is well hidden several miles in back of Anderson AFB.
                
                You can drive by the gate but it will not give you a view of all the antennas. You might see towers in the distance with all kinds of strange looking things on it. The missing antennas are on buildings and the ground, dishes and old fashioned wire antennas like the one for your TV before cable.
                
                There I am in that nest of the most highly secure military communication station in the US with connections to all over the world. I am the new guy in the crypto repair shop. No friends and kind of harassed the first couple of day, I did my job. I fixed broken crypto machines and teletype gadgets. The fourth day I get insulted by a guy and I happen to have a snappy comeback to him so we started talking. It turns out that he had spent a year in Nam on my sister ship, the Jamestown. I had been on the Oxford. We have both been in a place that was written about in books about the secret war in Viet Nam. T and I soon became close friends and after a time we became qualified to have off base housing. We decided to rent an apartment together but we needed a third because the place we wanted was three bedroom and the rent needed to be cut three ways. T knew a rookie who was fresh out of crypto school and this was his first real duty beside going to school. We were all well educated in crypto, electronics, and early digital information. The three of us got the apartment. T, myself and the fresh fish, whose name was David.
                
                What a wonderful time we had when we weren’t on duty. This huge apartment complex in Indian Hill, MD was full of young military and young secretaries for the government, mostly the FBI. In those days finger print analysis was entirely manual, requiring a huge number of file clerks. They were young too. The place was one continual party. No matter what time you got off duty and believe me the military gives you crazy hours there was a party to be found. It wasn’t even called crashing to attend parties you hadn’t been invited to. You went to them and met people and talked. You met women, beautiful, young, fun loving women.
                
                Soon we all had girlfriends. The parties occurred at our place and David, T and I lived the high life. The three of us became very close friends and did everything together. Everyone had a car except for T. I had a Covair with racing stripes and the hot 105 engine. David had a 63 Chevy 283 Impala. One night David and his girlfriend, Pat came to pick me up about midnight. I was getting off of shift that ended at 11PM, but by the time I got all the secret crap back where it belonged and went through the various check points midnight was a good guess.
                
                There was a problem though. I had my car and David did not know. Earlier I had driven myself to duty that day. Off we go back to the apartment, David and Pat in his 283 and me in my spiffy four on the floor Corvair. Despite what Nader did to the Corvair I maintain it was as good a car as any. Given the situation and our wild ways, the world is ours ideas, we started pushing it going down the back road. The faster Chevy that David was in sped ahead, I could keep up with him in my Corvair on the twisty two lane black top. We raced down the road, living life to its fullest and got to the main drag that leads to the on ramp onto the Washington Beltway.
                
                At the last light I am in back of David in the right lane sitting there waiting for it to get green. Before the light changes, a red 63 Ford Galaxy pulls up next to David. He revs his engine and David revs his. The light turns green and the both burn rubber heading for the on ramp. The red Ford gets there slightly first and cuts David off. Road rage has begun. David is a hot head, and pursues the red Ford. I try to keep up but we are now on a big wide highway with plenty of gentle curves and long straight sections and I am a bit behind them. It is late and there are few cars on the road. The race ensues as they hit a stretch that goes slightly down hill and back up again.
                
                I see them and they are nose to nose and really flying at this point I have the Corvair up to 80 and they are pulling away from me. The beltway is three lanes at this section and there is a car in the middle lane driving the speed limit. David goes around the car in the right lane and the red Ford goes left. Zipping past the slow car they both try to pull into the middle lane at the same time. The cars sideswipe and both swerve and slow down. The red Ford has dropped its muffler and it was leaving a shower of sparks behind it.
                
                The red Ford pulls off on the shoulder and David stops right behind him. As I pull up and over, I see David get out of his car and walk towards the Ford. I am preparing to help David but I see he has reached the door of the Ford. There is a brief moment and David speaks. Then I see him slump to the ground. David is just laying there and the Ford peals out back onto the beltway leaving behind a trail of sparks.
                
                I run to David. He is mumbling as I approach, but when I reach him I can tell he is unconscious and not responding. He is breathing though. I run to his car and tell Pat to go to one of the call boxes that were along the beltway and get help.
                
                Back to David I run and he is out of it. I decide to treat him for shock because I don’t know what happened to him. I lift his legs so that they are in a position that is higher than his head and I put my jacket on him. As I am getting ready to button David’s jacket first, I notice a small round circle of blood on his chest. It was smaller than the palm of a hand, but not much. I button him up. When his coat is closed I see a knife he carried. It was about 6″ in length but not finished. The point was rounded and the blade not sharpened. He has not finished making the knife. I was helping him with it. I collect knives, mostly small pocket folders and I know a lot about knives. The ones I collect are new and works of art. David’s knife lay next to him and there was blood on his chest. I made the assumption that he had pulled the knife on the Ford and the driver managed to push it back into David’s chest. There was so little blood that I did not need to put a compress on it.
                
                Sirens then and the police arrived. Pat had scooted in high heels to the nearest box quickly and the police were there. Ten minutes had not elapsed between sitting at the red light and the police arriving and David out of it on the ground. Two state police pull over, one in front of David and one in back of my Corvair, The first one sees David laying on the ground with his legs propped up runs to him, looks for a moment then runs straight toward me. He grabs me, spins me and cuffs me. Suddenly I am locked into the back of his patrol car as he talks on the radio for several moments.
                
                Then he questions me. I tell the cop the whole road rage story including my involvement in it. The ambulance rolls up with more lights than a UFO. Minutes go by as I tell my story. I finish and the cop gets out of the car and goes and talks to the paramedics. He comes back and lets me out of the patrol car and unlocks the cuffs. Then we walk back to David who is still on the ground. Three paramedics stand there waiting and the cop says to me I want you to go look at your friend and verify that he is dead.
                
                l am stunned. No words come out of my mouth. As the paramedics lift him onto the stretcher, no need for care, he is just a body now, I see the back of his jacket is soaked in blood. The whole back is dripping and there is a hole in David’s back the size of a softball with wet blue Melton wool from a Pea coat, peeled back and shredded into points like a little crown.
                
                Next I am in the state police headquarter for most of the eastern half of the beltway. I am questioned three times by three different detectives. I repeatedly describe the red Ford. I could pick it out today. I find in my memory a partial plate number. Next I am taken into a grim looking room instead of the detectives desk and I am asked where did he get the marijuana? I had know idea David had a joint, because even though we smoked it was rarely. Pot was very hard to get and of poor quality. That is why David came and got me. The three of us, Pat, David and I were going to catch a mild buzz off of that joint. It was party time in DC. It was very nerve racking though, because people in the government, the bureaucrats, took a dim view of sailors with top secret clearances working for the NSA getting stoned. This was the age of Bob Dylan singing “Everybody Must Get Stoned.” I told the cop without lying that I had no idea about any marijuana.
                
                To wrap the story up I then get taken back to my base, NAVCOMSTA Washington, DC and go through the whole process again. This time with several quartermaster SP’s. No mention of the joint though. The shore patrol tells me that David was shot in the middle of the chest with a very high caliber gun. His remains will be immediately transferred to NYC because David is Jewish and must be buried within 24 hours. T accompanies David’s coffin, draped with the flag. I sit on the train. David is buried with a color guard but no honors like a gun salute. This all happened in less time than a day. One evening I am talking to David and Pat and before dark the next day I am attending his funeral on Long Island, NYC. T and I are asked to join the minion and we sit Shiva with David’s friends and relatives.
                
                David was 20. His life ended that night 50 years ago and I still remember him and that night. Yes, I saw him murdered with a gun.
                
                Some of my time was spent with the grand jury, appearing and testifying before them. They come to a decision and it was ruled self defense. David was shot with a hand gun the guy kept in his huge Ford glove box. The gun was .44 caliber Buntline Special using magnum ammunition. Buntline means extra long barrel. David was a hot head. I didn’t see him pull the knife and I saw the whole scene. I assume he had it stuck in his belt and that is why his jacket was open. If the man hadn’t had the gun David and the man would have both been alive today. The gun was illegal. It was concealed which was also against the law. The red Ford driver was not allowed to own a gun because of previous infractions. David would have never stabbed him. The worst that could have happened was a fist fight. The red Ford did not know that. Did that give him the right to shoot someone not brandishing a weapon and kill him?
                
                I am against guns. There are too many damn guns in America, but I will rant about that later.
                
                Please, no “don’t take a knife to a gun fight” jokes.</p>
